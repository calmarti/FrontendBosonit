                <h2>Introduction</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm, statically-typed, general-purpose programming language that was design with a
                focus on safety and performance by Software developer Graydon Hoare while working at Mozilla Research in
                2006.
                Rust has recently become popular for systems programming and is expected to be merged into the
                Linux's kernel
                by 2023. One of the great features of Rust is that challenges the idea that high-level ergonomics
                and low-level control are not possible to reconcile in programming language design.
            <p>In recent years Rust's popularity has grown among developers according to Stackoverflow. Apart from
                systems' programming, it has a variety of use cases which include game development, web development,
                data science, and virtual reality.

            <header>
                <h2>Getting started</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>In order to get going with Rust you have to download it through <a
                        href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">
                        rustup</a>, a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. </p>
                <h3>Intalling rustup on Linux or macOS</h3>
                <p>Open a terminal and enter the following command:</p>

                <code>$ curl --proto '= https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh</code>
                <p>The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the rustup tool, which installs the
                    latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password.</p>
                <p>Once the installation is succesful, you will also need a linker, which is a program that Rust uses to
                    join its compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get linker
                    errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a linker. A C compiler is also
                    useful because some common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C compiler.</p>
                <p>Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their distribution’s documentation.
                    For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install the build-essential package.</p>
                <h3>Installing rustup on Windows</h3>
                <p>On Windows, go <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">here</a> and follow the instructions
                    for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll receive a message explaining that
                    you’ll also need the MSVC build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later. To acquire the build tools,
                    you’ll need to install Visual Studio 2022. When asked which workloads to install, include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Desktop Development with C++”</li>
                    <li>The Windows 10 or 11 SDK</li>
                    <li> The English language pack component, along with any other language pack of your choosing</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
            <header>
                <h2>Hello World</h2>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, let’s write your first Rust program. It’s traditional when learning a
                    new language to write a little program that prints the text Hello, world!.</p>

                <p>Create a new source file and call it main.rs. Rust files always end with the .rs extension. If you’re
                    using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them.
                    For example, use hello_world.rs rather than helloworld.rs.
                    Now open the main.rs file you just created and enter the code:</p>
                <code>
              fn main() {println!("Hello, World!");
            }</code>
                <p>And voilà, the println! macro prints the message to standard output</p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
            <header>
                <h2>Data types</h2>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Rust is a statically typed language. Every value in Rust is of a certain data type. The compiler
                    can automatically infer data type of the variable based on the value assigned to it.
                    Built-in types are tightly integrated into the language, in nontrivial ways that are not
                    possible to emulate in user-defined types. User-defined types have limited capabilities.
                <p>The list of types is as follows:</p>

                <h4>Primitive types</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                    <li>Numeric</li>
                    <li>Textual</li>
                    <li>Never</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sequence types</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tuple</li>
                    <li>Array</li>
                    <li>Slice</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Function types</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functions</li>
                    <li>Closures</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pointer types</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>References</li>
                    <li>Raw pointers</li>
                    <li>Function pointers</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>
                <h2> Variables</h2>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>In Rust variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a
                    way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However, you still
                    have the option to make your variables mutable.</p>
                <p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value. To
                    illustrate this, open src/main.rs and replace its code with the following code. This code won’t
                    compile just yet, we’ll first examine the immutability error.</p>
                <p>Filename: src/main.rs</p>
                <code>fn main() {
                let x = 5;
                println!("The value of x is: {x}");
                x = 6;
                println!("The value of x is: {x}");
            }</code>
                <p>Save and run the program using cargo run. You should receive an error message, as shown in this
                    output:</p>
                <code>$ cargo run Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
             error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
              --> src/main.rs:4:5</code>
                <p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs. Compiler errors can be
                    frustrating, but really they only mean your program isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet;
                    they do not mean that you’re not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler
                    errors.
                    The error message indicates that the cause of the error is that you cannot assign twice to immutable
                    variable `x`, because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable x variable.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
            <header>
                <h2> Functions</h2>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Functions are prevalent in Rust. Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function
                    and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words. Here’s a
                    program that contains an example function definition:

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Filename: src/main.rs
                </p>
                <code>

                    fn main() {  <br>
                        println!("Hello, world!"); <br>
                        
                        another_function(); <br>
                    }  <br>
                    <br>

                    fn another_function() { <br>
                        println!("Another function."); <br>
                    }                  
                </code>
                We define a function in Rust by entering fn followed by a function name and a set of parentheses.
                The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.

                We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses.
                Because <em>another_function</em> is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the
                <em>main</em> function. Note that we defined <em>another_function</em> after the <em>main</em>
                function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn’t care where you
                define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the
                caller.
